title: Is Accessing this Site a Bad Idea
---
Google Chrome has changed the way web develupers design for the better, but not all of there changes are good ideas. It seems like a few times a year Chrome will do an update that breaks my develupment work flow. At my company we have many internal systems that use a self signed certificat. Since only develupers access these servers for testing, the only important thing is that the certificat works. Not that it has a crediable certificate authority. If your like me and you just want to access the site try clicking the "ADVANCED" button and typing "badidea" without the quotes. This little trick can be a life saver and Chorme remembers your selection for a while so you do not need to do this every time you access the site!
