* Run a live iso of ubuntu and start gparted
	- Many people said you could use gparted for the whole process, but I could not due to the fact that I was using a lvm file system
* Create a new partition and save it with Edit > Apply All Operations (Ctrl + Return)

	- You can run lvdisplay and see that the new size has been applied, but if you run "df -h" the room is not being used.
	- To fix this run "resize2fs /dev/media-vg/root"
	- To check if this worked reboot and run df -h again
